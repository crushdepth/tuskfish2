## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities by email to simon 'at' isengard.biz. All
such reports are appreciated.

Please allow me four weeks to fix the issue before publicly disclosing it.
I may ask for more time if I need it. Vulnerabilities that are responsibly
disclosed will be publicly credited in patch/commit notes together with
the notification date.

Thanks.
