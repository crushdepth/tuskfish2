Next feature: Convert static from content type to boolean property
==================================================================

Upgrading legacy behaviour
--------------------------
* Don't filter tags in the stream, rather, make them static by default.
  Then people don't have to do anything, but they can turn them off if they want.
  However, this will mess up tag select box behaviour.
* Presently, tags cannot be turned off.
* Should non-feed content items be included when collections are viewed?
  - Yes: They are just not listed in the primary feed themselves
    but are still publicly available.
* YES: Are listing / RSS models taking into account inFeed settings on count()
  ie. for correct pagination?

TAG BEHAVIOUR
  - Tags are not listed in the stream or RSS feed (this is longstanding default).
    - setCriteria() excludes them
  - tags are not listed as child content when parent collections are viewed.
    Even when they are marked online.
  - tags are listed in the select box options no matter what, if there is content associated
    with them, even if they are marked offline.
      - this is fixable by modifying activeTagOptions() to not return ID of offline tags.
      - it does not solve the problem of tags that have offline content associated with them.

POLICY
------
* Offline = 1 turns all content OFF in every sense. Re. tags:
  - Offline tags are not available in search, select box, or via direct link
  - Offline tags are not listed in single object view
* InFeed = 0 removes all content from:
    - news feed
    - RSS feed
    - Tag selection box (if tag) - this requires modification of activeTagOptions()
* InFeed = 1 leaves all content available via:
    - direct access
    - search results
    - tag and collection listings (?)
    - as listed tags in single object view

PROBLEM:
  - What if I want to use a tag as a navigation item (select box) but not have it in the feed?
    This is quite a likely scenario.
  - inFeed = 1
    - include in feed / RSS
    - include in tag select box
  - inFeed = 0
    - exclude from feed / RSS
    - exclude from tag select box.
  - Compromise: Tags will remain excluded from feeds, and inFeed will merely control whether they
    are included in select box or not.
      - Tags are primarily navigation aids, they are very much static content.
      - So: Treat them as static content.
      - Change language constant for inFeed when content type = tag (Include in tag select box)

Legacy behaviour: Collections do not list child tags, even if they are online.
  - They are treated as static.
  - Should this behaviour be switched? YES
    - It was previously done for cosmetic reasons. Now, we have the 'compact' template option for
      collections which is capable of automatically generating a list.

Legacy behaviour: Tags are not included in the stream or RSS feed.
  - The reason was that tags are mostly navigation aids, rather than everyday content,
    just as static pages are not really mainstream content.
  - Should this change?
    - FOR: Transfer control to inFeed, can be customised for individual tags.
    - AGAINST: Lose option to control use in tag select box.

Legacy behaviour: Active tags are included in the select box even if offline.
  - Not sure why, originally offline tags were excluded from select box.
  - Should this change?
    - FOR: Yes, it gives a means to control select box contents without resorting to custom collections.
      Control should be via the inFeed switch.
    - Against: None.

Legacy behaviour: Offline tags are still online in most senses.
  - Originally this was a mechanism to get them out of the select box (which no longer works).
    Tags were kept online due to their role in site navigation.
  - The inFeed switch provides an alternative, ie. can leave them online, but keep out of feed.

CHANGES
-------
Single view:
  - Remove offline tags (keep inFeed = 0 tags)
  - Offline tags are not available for single object view (admin excepted)
ListView/RSS:
  - Mod activeTagOptions() to exclude i) offline tags and ii) inFeed=0 tags
  - Verify that tags are always excluded from stream
  - Verify that tags are always excluded from RSS feeds
Collection:
  - Tags are included in child content listing.
  - Pagination controls reflect their inclusion - check count() methods

Issues:
-------
* Remove static as whitelisted content type (content trait, form validation scripts, CRUD viewmodels/models?)
* Add static as a boolean DB field to the installer script
* Add static as a boolean property of content objects (default 1) + getters / setters
* Add static to CRUD validation routines
* Add static === 1 as a criteria item on listView VM + models
* Add static ==== 1 as criteria item on RSS VM + models

Migrating a legacy site
-----------------------
* Covert existing static pages to some other type.
* Set each one to static=1.
