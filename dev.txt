Next feature: Convert static from content type to boolean property
==================================================================

Issues:
-------
* Remove static as whitelisted content type (content trait, form validation scripts, CRUD viewmodels/models?)
* Add static as a boolean DB field to the installer script
* Add static as a boolean property of content objects (default 1) + getters / setters
* Add static to CRUD validation routines
* Add static === 1 as a criteria item on listView VM + models
* Add static ==== 1 as criteria item on RSS VM + models

Migrating a legacy site
-----------------------
* Covert existing static pages to some other type.
* Set each one to static=1.
